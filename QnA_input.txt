Are children will be psychologicaly affected more than adults by the pandemic of Covid-19? 
I guess, it depends on the atmosphere that they are belonging to. Children, always, in all situations, are the reflection of their own other family members. Those are the main effectiveness of children at home. For kids, staying home orders are slightly a "Mess", and nonsense. So, as we are dealing with such pandemic, we have to keep an eye on them, ALWAYS. THAT MATTERS FOR SURE.

Study recruitment using reddit?
I've used the "subreddit" r/samplesize for recruitment, its dedicated directly for this purpose (instructions on how to post, etc., are contained in the sidebar). I got about 200 participants in of a month using this approach, and my IRB did not ask any questions. I think posting recruitment ads on other subreddits (related to disease states, etcc)  is at the discretion of the moderators. I asked about one and was told no.

Ethically, how problematic is asking participants with anxiety to only fill an online survey while in a state of anxiety or panic?
If you are in a panic attack you probably do not go to the computer to fill in a form. You can administer Beck anxiety inventory  (BAI) and people can fill in all the symptoms they experience, I am sure they remember the symptoms  well after some attacks.

Is the GAD-7 an adequate screening measure for anxiety disorders?
Dear Dr Gonzalez-Robles,Anxiety disorders are a large group of different disorders with their on symptomatology, short and long term course. If you plan to include patients with different anxiety disorders in your trial, I suggest to use the MINI (International Neuropsychiatry Interview) for DSM5 for diagnosis and the HAMA (Hamilton Scale for Anxiety) and CGI (Clinical Global Impression ) for severity. They could be in your inclusion/exclusion criteria.BestAntonio

Effects of relaxation trainings on anxiety disorders
Anxiety plays the very disturbing parts according to the nature problem & to me this implies from small category person to the higher level of person .It is in this line sometime back I have expressed my views  Anxiety depend on the nature of every individual person depending upon the problem & the period for which they have to pass . In case of individual certain person are wide powerful in their individual sensitivity & they are facing problem as it come believe in that we have to cooperate with the inevitable .As we know which well many person they have to pass their various phase of their disturbing problem of the life . Children problem ,illness & death in the family ,difference with the member of the family ,illness calling for long waiting period with the use experiences,disturbing illness like Cancer, death of the husband or wife ,are the problem which remain the part of anxiety for such long duration & this can be avoided only with the passage of time .This is my personal opinion
Are those diagnosed with anxiety disorders eligible for test taking accommodations according to ADA, IDEA and Section 504?
As a practitioner at the secondary level, 504 Plan accommodations for state testing was limited to 'extended time' and 'quiet space'.  By the time I left the classroom in 2016, it was getting harder to get accommodations for students with anxiety disorders under 504 Plans.  As the student population increased it was also harder to find facility space to meet the above accommodations.
Anxiety disorder and harming family members. 
While there may be research showing that individual's with GAD or social anxiety disorder exhibit more anger, I have never run across this in my own life.  I have dealt with GAD, Social Anxiety, and Panic Attacks for over 40 years now.  If anything, and this is related to only my own experiences and friends who have dealt with the same issues, those of us with social anxiety (especially) tend to retreat rather than react.  During a panic attack, a true, certified panic attack, there is absolutely no time or opportunity to show anger or violence.  Panic attacks are all consuming and if there is ever a moment where it is "all about me", it is during a panic attack.  For example, I pray that nothing dangerous happens to someone I love during one of my panic attacks because I simply would not be able to respond to it.  Social Anxiety, in my case again, led to 2 years of agoraphobia because I chose to go off of my medication.  Even after being back on my medication for over 2 years now, if there is a line at Walmart and it doesn't move fast enough, I will first kneel down.  If after kneeling for several minutes it is not yet my turn to check out, I will simply leave my cart and go home.  Those I know who have dealt with either social anxiety or generalized anxiety tend to have similar reactions, although perhaps not as exacerbated.  I guess what I am trying to show by the examples I have given, is that I do not see aggression and anger being part of anxiety UNLESS the person has a co-morbid issue involving either a secondary psychological disorder or a substance abuse disorder.  I hope this helped a little!

Are there cut-offs for different anxiety levels on the STAI-6?
David,There are actually a few of them out there
Are there other similar experiences like Praecox Feeling in relation to other diagnoses?
This answer reflects my experiences in 15 years of actual nearly full-time clinical practice.  I believe these are the sorts of answer you were pursuing?  1) There are times that walking into the hospital room of a patient who is severely depressed feels as if there is a palpable gust of "sad" that "comes off" the patient (this is not literal of course).  I have described this experience over the years to students and trainees as similar to the actual gust of heat one feels when opening the door of an oven that has been at 400 F for a while. 2) I think we can all universally agree there are some persons with Autism you meet and it's completely clear immediately - by this I mean the sort of classic, profound Autism characterized by a person being non-verbal, lacking joint attention, and engaging in repetitive, self-stimulatory behaviors.  When people say they "just know" someone has Autism without doing a complete diagnostic short of those sorts of presentations, frankly I get concerned.  3) As for ADHD, many times you will see behaviors from a child that could have you immediately conclude that the child must have it, until you take a history that includes significant trauma.  So that immediate feeling is not trustworthy at all, and because it can be strong, has to be actively fought against.  I'm sure there are other similar phenomena if you were to ask people who do a lot of clinical work.  I believe that all of this is what is intended to be captured under the concept of transference.  But that does not mean it isn't possibly worthy of more careful description and understanding than lumping into one big pot.
Zung Self-Rating Anxiety Scale
As the questionnaire was actually published in the journal, i.e. one can simply copy the questions from that, this would usually be considered as in the public domain. Although some organizations may be selling copies of the scale, I doubt they have any right to claim copyright. They may be able to claim some rights to their actual copy, in their particular design layout, but not for the questions. In short, you could just make your own copy from the questions listed in the article. 
Does abusing children change their DNA?
Just like environmental factors, psychological factors may have an impact on gene expression and its regulatory mechanisms but the extent of impact would be depndent on multifactorial aspects and would need to be ascertained in a case to case basis.
Anxiety disorders in children
 As a special education teacher and person with anxiety disorder, I found the ACE-Adverse Childhood Experience studies of 1995-97 to be both professionally and personally helpful to me and my research. It found that many psychiatric challenges result from traumatic events in early life, including drug and alcohol use and addictions. Left untreated these experiences can lead to severe physical illnesses and possibly early death. I support your efforts in studying this topic and suggest a qualitative study because you have a small sample which will allow a deeper study of the children as some children will need more time to develop trust and provide fear-free answers to your research questions.

Trauma Induced OCD vs 'Normal' OCD?
OCD is similar to many other psychiatric disorders in that the manifestation of the 'symptoms' are  incredibly heterogeneous.  For example there are 636,120 different ways to have post traumatic stress disorder based on current psychiatric diagnosis, and there are so many ways that psychotic symptoms can be combined that it makes it nonsensical to consider these as discrete disorders.  Therefore it is incredibly unlikely that there is a simple genetic explanation for these complex and multi-faceted disorders. 
Social phobia and higher IQ? How to survive?
 The society of people assesses the outstanding abilities of personalities in their Creativity. The criterion of genius is the real creations of Human, the novelty and genius of the newly created. At the same time, intellectual tests go to the background. Such tests are a kind of reference point for judging the potential intellectual abilities of a person. But a person is judged by his Creations, and not by intentions to create something unusual. 
OCD Vs Superstition?
To Beatrice: Checking whether the frontdoor has really been closed is a trivial job with an easy to check result: yet a part of the OC patients cannot become convinced. Looking whether you have extinguished the light is as simple job: yet a part of the OC patients have to return to the room time and again to see whether they really did. In due time they may not even be able to convince themselves when they are still in the room, which is already dark. Etc.

The Period of Presocial Anxiety In Patients With Social Anxiety Disorder?
Our hypothesis was published in the Journal of Early Intervention In Psychiatry.  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27585496We describe a prodromal period consisting of three stages. Every year millions of children around the world develop social phobia (from ADHD to social phobia). Social phobia can be captured in the prodromal period  and treated. Just as cancer patients captured during the period of pre-cancer (such as metaplasia, dysplasia), social anxiety can also be captured and treated in early stages. Now we are working on a scale to describe the period of Presocial anxiety.

Which is the best scale of Electroencephalogram (EEG) to study anxiety and depression in patients ?
To the best of my knowledge as a former EEG researcher, the EEG does not produce a reliable way to measure anxiety. As you may know, the EEG reflects only that part of the brain's electrical functioning that can cross the rather nonconductive skullbone. In addition, it reflects only a weak vector summation of millions of synapses. Finally, the signal is masked by the blood vessels of the head, large and small, which conduct various electrical signals (including Alpha waveforms) much better than bone due to their being filled with blood, which is electrically conductive due to its salt content.While there is much controversial or fringe research that shows various EEG effects as a result of meditation, anxiety, and even thinking and task-solving, none of this research, to the best of my knowledge, is part of accepted medical knowledge. It cannot as yet be considered fact.If you want a reliable measure of anxiety, you cannot do better than the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Adults (STAI Form Y), available at http://www4.parinc.com/Products/Product.aspx?ProductID=STAI . This is an accepted psychological instrument, having itself been validated in various human populations.Research involving a measurement of anxiety that is based only on EEG readings may have only limited acceptance due to its dependence on the unreliability and lack of validation of the EEG as a measure of anxiety, to the best of my knowledge.
What are the motivations of people with severe mental illness to enter or return to work?
I suspect you will find that the motives vary widely. Some are too ill to work. Some would like to work but the only jobs available pay less than a disability subsidy so it doesn't seem worth it. Some get discouraged looking for work and getting continuously turned down. Some don't know how to go about finding appropriate work that they can do. Some do find work and then lose it either because of symptoms, side effects, or stigma. Some don't know what to put on the application form with respect to their illness. Some don't know whether or not to ask for accommodations. Some have no one to use as a reference. Some don't know how to organize a resume. Some think the stress of work will increase their symptoms. Some think the available jobs are beneath them. Some would do anything for a bit of extra money. Some prefer night work or solitary work. Some have no means of transportation to get to work..........

What is your experience, either experimental or anecdotal, with pregabalin (LYRICA) for generalized anxiety disorder?
Dr. Sood - Since Lewis put this question in the realm of *anecdotal* evidence as well as traditional EBM/PCT etc, I would note some serious downsides to the atypical antipsychotics, which I'm sure come as no surprise to you (1) pts generally report dissatisfaction with the "feeling" of olanzapine, quetiapine, and risperidone as compared to that of BZDs (most preferable) and pregabalin (next most preferable) - while they certainly have therapeutic value, the atypical antipsychotics are disliked by many patients, and thus result in much lower adherence -- they control anxiety at a cost generally not attributed to gabaergics. ¬†(2) The jury is still out on the risks of permanent dyskinesia from all three atypical mentioned -- little research here, but litigation aplenty. ¬†For *some* patients, I agree that atypicals can be used to manage anxiety. ¬†For many, and ANECDOTALLY, for very high functioning pts, the "downside" to the atypicals outweighs the "upside". ¬†That is why I think PGN, as a weaker (less addictive, less dependence-forming) gabaergic, has so much promise - it is well-tolerated, has high adherence, and as your quote states, seems to be effective in keeping pts from "relapsing" (either to BZDs or to GAD or both) after they are weaned from BZDs. ¬†I would also suggest looking at the extensive literature on gabapentin, which I believe has a similar mechanism of action as PGN but is even weaker. ¬†It may be appropriate for some pts with GAD and or BZD dependency. ¬†
What's the role of serotonin in induction of anxiety?
Several lines of evidence implicate decreased serotonergic activity in anxiety and major depression, but its importance in the etiology and severity of these disorders remains unclear. Acute tryptophan depletion studies support a role for decreased serotonin in depression, or at least in relapse of recovered depressed patients. Imaging and post-mortem studies indicate altered activity of discrete regions within the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and their atrophy are associated with depression. Genetic polymorphisms in serotonin genes [e.g., 5-HT transporter (5-HTT), 5-HT1A receptor] have been associated with depression, but these associations are weak and not always reproducible, suggesting that serotonin may be a predisposing factor rather than a cause of depression or anxiety. Pl. refer following thread for further details:-http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4047678/

Do you have an idea or guidelines about reducing anxiety preoperative?
Hello Hani,This is an interesting area that the nurses at the Surgical unit discussed in their Nursing Journal Club months ago. They've discussed the same review article that Abdulqadir attached for you.They were thinking to conduct an Evidence-based project to look for literature to¬†allievate pre-surgical stresses. Interestingly, the issue raised after observing high blood pressure readings and taccycardia the night before surgey.There is many feasable interventions that can be done such as (1) pre-operative structured visits the night before the surgery; (2) ¬†Patients' round to Operation theatre before surgey. The latest might be argumentative, however there might be a¬†turn around in bringing the theatre to them :) such as providing a friendly-booklet with real pictures and discription of the operation theatre environment.

Why some mice prefer to stay in the light compartment of the dark/light transition test following stress?
Based on my experience working with the Elevated Plus Maze, less anxious or stressed rats tend to spend more time in the open/bright arm of the maze, but will spend more time in the dark arm as a result of anxiety or stress. However, contamination may easily influence¬†experiments such as this. If you test a couple of rats using the same equipment without cleaning between sessions, they may just stay around where the previous mice stayed regardless if they are stressed or not, because they feel comfortable.

All scales are validated for children 7 and more years old!Personally, I do not believe that any other anxiety disorder can start at this age except specific phobia....and this also can be developmental characteristic. However, I am very interested in seeing your results!Dejan
Does anyone know of any measurement tools to assess outcomes of Critical Incident Interventions?
Hello and although this does not directly address the question, I suggest that¬†reading the Cochrane Collaboration review on this might be helpful to you (it provides a systematic review of the literature).¬†¬†Psychological Debriefing for Preventing PTSD (Rose, Bisson and Wessely). I am a co-author.
Can I use elevated plus maze as a pre-test to control for anxiety levels in two groups?
Using the same test twice can dramatically affect performance on the second test. ¬†I agree that using an alternate test of anxiety would help- you could do open field, and look at center time/surround time, light-dark box, or defensive burying.However, that won't solve your problem of high baseline levels of anxiety. ¬†It could have to do with rat strain, level of food deprivation, time of day for testing, sex or age of the rats, or level of lighting. ¬†Here's just one example of a paper that demonstrates how some of these things can affect performance on the EPM- there are many out there.http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25741257

How to test capacity to make medical decisions in a pt. who has selective mutism?
I have always reasoned that a patient who elects not to communicate is for the physicians' purposes in the same position as a patient who cannot communicate.¬† His wishes are not communicated.¬† In this sense, failure to exercise a capacity is the same as lacking capacity.¬† Dr. Breen's reasoning is similar.¬†
How distinct is performance only social anxiety disorder from nonperformance only social anxiety disorder?
I only attempt an answer to your first question: Social anxiety disorder is strongly based on unrealistic expectations about other people's¬†faultfinding¬†interest in your performance of even trivial¬†tasks like pouring¬†out a cup of coffee ("do they see that my hand is shaking? What will they think of me when they see my hand is shaking? etc.). It testifies of a strong uncertainty about oneself, probably fostered¬†by a learning history with much criticism and rejection by one's parents or one's peer group. In public speaking the expectations of a critical audience and of the impact of making mistakes are much more realistic. And the risk of making mistakes is much greater, just because one's performance is under pressure. The task is not trivial and it needs much training to become skilled in it.Whether there is a physiological difference between the reactions of a social phobic and a person who fears public speaking seems to me of subordinate interest.
What are the risks of practicing mindfulness?
Hi Ahmad,When the body and mind enter stillness, what is already there - experiences held in ¬†mind¬†memory and tissue-held memory in the body, may emerge. ¬†In my studies and practices in bodywork, energy work, mindfulness/meditation, yoga, etc., there has always been reference to these possibilities and recommendations to seek professional medical assistance, i.e. counseling services to work through what may bubble up. ¬†The consequences you are contemplating are really a person's baggage unpacking, and that movement is¬†a path toward¬†wholeness. At¬†the same time, special attention¬†is prudent¬†because a flood is not so healthy rather a gentle peeling of the layers¬†as the person is ready.¬†¬†In short, it's not so much the methods that pose risk (in my opinion) but the resistance to acknowledge what's there, the readiness/committment to "do the work", and the willingness to¬†seek appropriate services ¬†which may include a variety of providers, strategies, and most importantly, timing. Your thoughts?Best,Victoria
Are there any experts on computer anxiety?
Dear Francis,Thank you for the invitation, and I look forward to presenting the webinar on computer anxiety in healthcare professionals to your group at the University of the Philippines, Manila.
Chronic stress leads to anxiety or depression?
Very interesting discussion. It's interesting that the literature really does not try to parse out when stressors lead to either depression or anxiety, as they are highly comorbid with each other, and they overlap with multiple symptoms. Even their treatments with CBT and antidepressants are similar, and making determinations if this is anxiety or depression really does not matter much, as it does not inform further clinical treatments. In my clinical experience, stressors are either handled via adaptive coping skills, or they aren't via maladaptive ones. These patients may then start having adjustment problems, and you notice the specifiers for adjustment disorder includes -with anxiety, -with depressed mood, and -with anxiety and depressed mood. If the stressors continue, then either a depressive disorder or an anxiety disorder emerges, and this tends to go back to CBT theory about thoughts and appraisals about the fearful stimuli and stressors, and this seems to be¬†a significant¬†variable which in turn determines which disorder emerges.It also appears that¬†anxiety and depression share the same neurobiology: it comes down to the interaction of genetic vulnerabilities (family history) with environmental influences (major life stressors), and it is this interaction which leads to abnormal processing circuits in the brain (hyperactivity of the amygdala to fearful stimuli and stressors). This hypothesis has been supported by a recent study which revealed that people with increased reactivity of their amygdala to fearful stimuli (as measured on fMRI), when they also experience a major life stressor, are more at risk to developing either anxiety or depression up to 4 years into the future:¬†http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25654256. Further research should examine how the differentiation is made between the development into depression or anxiety, following study subjects with high amygdala reactivity to fearful stimuli who have also endured a major life stressor. I hypothesize that it is the thoughts and appraisals of the stressors which differentiates anxiety from depression, as discussed previously by other researchers who have replied to this interesting thread.
Can depressive symptoms differ between people?
I'd like to join others in saying "Yes" to your question, Ahmad.Indeed depression is a universal phenomenon and there are subtypes of depression. However, from the perspective of multicultural psychotherapy and international/global psychology, there are differences in one‚Äôs symptom manifestations, cultural explanations, and impact of depression on oneself and one‚Äôs intimates, depending on one‚Äôs cultural identification, acculturation to the Western cultural worldviews, and diverse backgrounds (Falicov, 2014; McGoldrick et al., 2005; Sue & Sue, 2013).In terms of treatment, there are also differences in one's expectations of the treatment goals, processes and relationship with the healer (Cheung, 2009; Hong & Ham, 2001).DSM-5 has provided an excellent outline for cultural formulation (OCF) and Cultural Formulation Interview (CFI).DSM5CulturalFormulationInterview.pdf407.31 KB
Is there research that considers how perceptible panic attacks are to observers?
Hi Kelly,I did work on panic attacks many years ago. I recall that often times the person who is having the attack can not talk because his or her throat is so dry. This seemed to be overlooked in the literature at that time.
Can anxiety sensitivity predict psychotherapeutic outcomes in cognitive behavior therapy for emotional disorders?
Dear Omid,¬†Cogn Behav Ther. 2006;35(4):248-56.A brief cognitive-behavioral approach to reducing anxiety sensitivity decreases pain-related anxiety.Watt MC, Stewart SH, Lefaivre MJ, Uman LS.¬†AbstractAnxiety sensitivity (AS; fear of anxiety-related sensations) is a known risk factor for anxiety disorders and recently has been linked to pain disorders. The present study was guided by the hypothesis that a program designed to reduce AS levels might also result in a decrease in anxiety related to pain sensations. Female undergraduates, selected as either high or low in AS according to screening scores on the Anxiety Sensitivity Index (ASI), were randomly assigned to participate in 3 1-hour, small group sessions of either cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT; psycho-education, cognitive restructuring, and interoceptive exposure) or a non-specific treatment (NST). Immediately prior to and following the intervention, participants completed the 20-item Pain Anxiety Symptoms Scale (PASS-20). Consistent with hypothesis, results revealed a 3-way interaction between AS group, intervention condition, and time on PASS-20 total scores. Only participants with high pre-morbid levels of AS assigned to the CBT condition showed a significant reduction in scores on the PASS-20 from pre- to post-treatment. Implications for improving CBT approaches for pain disorders are discussed.

Can you recommend any articles about "being successfull in the host country arouse fear among migrants"?
Thinking about the phenomenon systemically and psychodynamically, an immigrant's success can have a reciprocal effect on him/her and his/her host country (e.g., how the host country views and responds to his/her success can affect how s/he feels about him/herself and his/her success, etc.). Being likely a minority in the host country, s/he might feel lonely/an outsider in his/her success; for some, it can arouse some angst or existential depression.

How do you deal with vertigo or acrophobia?
"Alfred Hitchcock knew a thing or two about the silver screen, but the man‚Äôs medical vocabulary left much to be desired: Contrary to what his iconic film would tell you, vertigo isn‚Äôt at all related to heights. It‚Äôs actually a sub-category of dizziness, which is a catchall term used to describe unsteady sensations.""Doctors break down dizziness into three subcategories: presyncope (feeling faint or light headed), disequilibrium (feeling off-balance) and the more familiar vertigo, defined as the sensation of motion where none actually exists. Different people experience vertigo in different ways; for some the world might be spiralling around them and others might be spiralling around the world.""Treatment can take one of three different forms. Sedatives such as Ativan or Lorazepam are commonly prescribed, because they mask the symptoms of BPPV. They don‚Äôt, however, affect the course of the disease. For people with severe vertigo, brain surgery may be required, although it‚Äôs only recommended for those with highly recurrent, entirely disabling episodes. But for up to 95 percent of sufferers, the most effective treatment is the Epley manoeuvre, a non-pharmaceutical procedure discovered fewer than 20 years ago. In fact, because the manoeuvre is still relatively new, patients see an average of three doctors and incur average costs of $2, 600 US in prescriptions and missed work before they receive the proper treatment, according to a U.S. study."‚ÄúThe Epley manoeuvre is a way of rolling the patient such that you get those crystals from the semicircular canal back to the saccule, where they‚Äôre supposed to be,‚Äù Bromwich describes.http://www.besthealthmag.ca/best-you/health/how-to-cope-with-vertigo
What is known about typology of school phobia/school refusal?
300.29 Specific Phobia - school.I have worked with many chronic "school refusers." Some are phobic others are not. If they are phobic, a desensitization protocol worked very well. I have them list all of the situations that they avoid. I have them then rate each item on the list ¬†from 1 to 10 for the severity of the anxiety associated and then sort from lowest to highest. I teach them a relaxation method if they don't know one. I then have them select an item to expose themselves to for a certain amount of time. I am sure you know the drill. Relax prior, predict the severity, expose, relax, rate the actual discomfort. Repeat. Once they experience a reduction in anxiety from repeated exposure; it becomes highly motivating and they are back in school within several months.

How does psychotherapy facilitates death anxiety in an existential point of view?
I do recommend to everyone here eliminating your own fear of death first, and completely, before advising clients or patients. Eliminating this fear has been very helpful for me in living a healthy, happy, and balanced life. There is no need for esoteric philosophies or mysticism in accomplishing this. It's an automatic by-product of any of several effortless practices.
Could anyone share your clinical experience regarding pharmacotherapy for hypersexuality in patients with neurocognitive disorders? Thank you!
Dear Chen-Chia,DEPENDS -- on the "cause" . . . Several years (decades) ago, my wife and I were invited to present at a symposium for elderly patients at a major psychiatric hospital. As we were both giving keynote addresses, we were invited on grand rounds.¬†One of the patients we encountered was an elderly man, a grandfather, who although he had developed Alzheimer's was reasonably well adjusted and living at home with his son's family. Everyone loved and helped care for "grandpa" until he started making unwarranted sexual comments and advances towards his two grand-daughters. Subsequently, several weeks before we met him, he was transferred to the long-term psychogeriatric ward of the hospital -- for permanent stay.Given his history, symptomatology, and the fact that we were both lecturing on the effects of medication use among the elderly, we suggested that his inappropriate behaviour might be due to a cyanocobalamin (vitamin B12) deficiency. A Shillings test revealed that his B12 level of extremely below normal. Subsequent daily injectable doses of 1000 mcg per day resulted in significant improvement in his mental status by the end of several weeks AND after several months, he was happily reunited with his family.A true story, with a happy ending, that we also reported on as a case history at that time in the medical literature (see my list of publications for the exact reference). This response does NOT detract from the excellent advice that our other 2 colleagues have already provided you with. BUT, it should ADD to that advice and be a reminder to all of us clinicians that the first and most common response is not always the best for a particular individual patient . . .I hope that this response is of some assistance.Sincerely,Lou
What is "alienation of peers"?
It's "peer alienation;" I think you hit a translation problem there. Basically, it refers to the extent to which a person is alienated from (feels separate from, is not accepted by, and may be subject to criticism or hostility from) his or her peers - those of a similar age and station in life. Mostly you hear about it with school-aged children.

What is the relationship between visual perception, stress and anxiety?
An interesting, free-ranging conversation. As a meditation teacher, I'm exclusively interested in dissolving and eliminating all stress, anxiety, and other negative effects that limit a person's functioning in life, that limit or prevent their natural experience of peace. love, and happiness. Nevertheless, I see the value of academic reasoning and research into all the topics that we are all raising here. While I recognize the value of research, I remain focused on directly helping people live better by eliminating their stored stresses so the nervous system can function fully and properly.
